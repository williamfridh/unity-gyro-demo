**This is a simple boilerplate I made to test the capabilities of a mobile device capability to use its gyroscope sensors to create a VR experience. The initiative was taken when exploring the different options for a VR game I got to develop as part of a course during my studies at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.**

Note that this repository is a test and contains a rather small amount of code which you can quickly learn from to get started with your own projects.
